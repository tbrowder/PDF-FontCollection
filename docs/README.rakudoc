=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<PDF::FontCollection> is a curated set of five collections of 
OpenType fonts available to install on Linux and MacOS. 
For Windows systems only the 'FreeFonts' collection is available,
but that set of fonts can handle most needs as it represents fonts
equivalent to the classic Adobe fonts Time, Helvetica, and Courier,
but with many more glyphs (800 or more).

This package enables easy handling of the NN (or NN for Windows) fonts 
by a mmemonic set of keys to show details by listing them, showing
all their attributes, getting their file path, or loading
them into a PDF document being generated with module 'PDF::Lite'.

=head1 Keys

The font keys consist of several alphanumeric characters (not 
case-sensitive). The first one or two alphabetic
characters represent a font collection:

=item C - Cantarell
=item E - E B Garamond
=item F - FreeFonts
=item L - Linux Libertine
=item U - URW Base 35

The next one or two numbers represent the font families in the set.
The remaining characters, if any, represent the bold and italic (or oblique)
versions of that font family. For example, using FreeFonts we list
several of the fonts:

=item f1   -  FreeSerif
=item f1b  -  FreeSerifBold
=item f1bi -  FreeSerifBoldItalic
=item f1ob -  FreeSerifBoldItalic

Notes:
1. The base font is also the name of the font family.
2. The style characters can be in any order, and the 
'i' (italic) and 'o' (oblique) mean the same in this context.

For certain font collections, there are fonts specifically designed to
be substitutes for the classic Adobe PostScript fonts: Times, Helvetica, 
and Courier. Those can be selected by using only the collection
character followed by all alphabetic characters. For example, the
FreeFonts were designed thusly and they can be referenced this way:

=item ft   -  Times
=item fh   -  Helvetica
=item fc   -  Courier

The URW Base 35 fonts also have Adobe PostScript equivalents:

=item ut   -  Times
=item uh   -  Helvetica
=item uc   -  Courier

Of course the bold or italic (or oblique) styles can indicated in the
usual way:

=item utb  -  TimesBold
